# Cell Phone Usage Report
Write a report for cell phone usages in the company for a given year, and print the report to your local printer.

### Build
Use Netbeans or maven to build
```mvn clean install```

### Assumptions
*	Let's do a windows GUI.
*	Makes sense to display report year in addition to generated date.
*	Averages are assuming employees used phones over entire year.
*	Duplicate date data: use first occured, discard later data.
*	Maybe a day is a reasonable time to complete this.

### Libraries
*	Guava
*	OpenCSV
*	AutoValue

### Thoughts
This was a fun project. Never tried printing before.
